/* n queens proble. what i need to do.
1// build the board( asci text)/  if you really want to be bold diferentiate color
//build the lines, then the inside of the boxes, trepetitivly.
populate the board (a 2d array. such that no two options are evert the same. 
maybe a way to save on memory would to move one piece and check rather that rebuilding every time. how would that work?
after either moving one piece or all pieces, check wether it works. if it does. print it and recored the number.
//maybe it woulb e better ot move all picece insted of all, incase it dosent work.
// i should create a way to store borards that work, so that i'm not printing out he same board 8 diffrnt times.*/
this is n queens, so it has to work for whatever number is input.
